\# SQL Practice with Chinook Database 🎶



\## 📌 Overview

This project is part of my AI Journey www.linkedin.com/in/ziad-bassem-9535b2265.

It uses the \*\*Chinook SQLite sample database\*\*, which represents a digital media store.

The database includes tables for:

\- Artists, Albums, Tracks

\- Customers and Invoices

\- Employees and Sales



I practiced core SQL concepts inside \*\*Jupyter Notebook\*\* and integrated results with \*\*Python (Pandas + Matplotlib)\*\* for analysis \& visualization.
